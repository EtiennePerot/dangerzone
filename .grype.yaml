  # CVE-2024-5171
  # =============
  #
  # NVD Entry: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-5171
  # Verdict: Dangerzone is not affected. The rationale is the following:
  #
  # The affected library, `libaom.so`, is linked by GStreamer's `libgstaom.so`
  # library. The vulnerable `aom_img_alloc` function is only used when
  # **encoding** a video to AV1. LibreOffce uses the **decode** path instead,
  # when generating thumbnails.
